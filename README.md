A DAL Utility for ADO.NET

### Steps to explore this utility #
1. Clone this repository

2. Run the Db Script to create the Test DB

3. Run the console program to test out using the wrapper methods. Feedback is provided to the console window

4. You can potentially utilize the utility by create a DLL from the class library DAL. However, I have not tested this myself yet.
